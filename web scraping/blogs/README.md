### Project Overview

This project involves the collection of blog posts from the CWCBExpo website, focusing specifically on their "Cannabis Means Business" series. The purpose of this web scraping is to aggregate content related to cannabis industry developments from [CWCBExpo Blogs](https://cwcbexpo.com/blog/).

### Data Collection

Using web scraping techniques, I have extracted blog posts in the following JSON format for each entry:

```json
{
  "title": "May 2024 Regional Cannabis News: Developments In NJ, NY And PA",
  "url": "https://cwcbexpo.com/may-2024-regional-cannabis-news/",
  "author": "CWCBExpo",
  "datePublished": "May 23, 2024"
}
```

Each JSON object represents a single blog post and includes the title, URL, author, and publication date.
