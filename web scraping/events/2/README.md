### Project Overview

This project is dedicated to scraping event information from the Cannabis Business Times events page. The aim is to compile a dataset of upcoming cannabis industry events, which can be utilized for analysis, planning, and engagement purposes.

### Data Collection

Events data is scraped from [Cannabis Business Times Events](https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/events/) and formatted as follows for each entry:

```json
{
  "title": "Flower Expo",
  "link": "https://theflowerexpo.com/massachusetts/",
  "date": "Wed, Jun 05 2024 - Thu, Jun 06 2024",
  "location": "Greenfield, MA"
}
```

Each JSON object captures the title, URL link, date range, and location of an event.
