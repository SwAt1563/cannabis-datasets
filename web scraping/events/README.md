## Cannabis Events Scraper

This project is focused on web scraping to collect data from the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission's events calendar at [MassCannabisControl Calendar](https://masscannabiscontrol.com/calendar/). The script captures details about each event including titles, URLs, dates, times, and more.

### Data Structure
