### Project Overview

This project is focused on scraping news data from the Cannabis Business Times, specifically from their [Top Stories section](https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/section/top-stories/). The main goal is to gather up-to-date information on the cannabis industry, which can be used for news aggregation, market analysis, and content curation.

### Data Collection

The news data is extracted and structured in the following JSON format for each news item:

```json
{
  "title": "What Are ESOPs and MEWAS and Why Might They Trend in Cannabis?",
  "content": "Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Multiple-Employer Welfare Arrangements could offer many cannabis employers a way to step up employee benefits, though compliance is key.",
  "author": "NAOMI TELLEZ",
  "date": "APRIL 10, 2024",
  "url": "https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/news/esops-and-mewas-and-why-they-might-trend-in-cannais/"
}
```

Each entry captures the title, content snippet, author, publication date, and URL of the article.
